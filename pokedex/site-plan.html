    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>The Pokémon franchise began in 1996 in Japan, created by Satoshi Tajiri
       and Ken Sugimori. Inspired by Tajiri’s childhood hobby of collecting insects,
        the idea evolved into a game where players would capture and trade creatures 
        called Pokémon. The first games, Pokémon Red and Green for the Game Boy, quickly
         became a national phenomenon and later spread worldwide. As the franchise grew,
          it expanded into an animated TV series starring Ash Ketchum, a trading card
           game, movies, toys, and countless spin-off games. Today, Pokémon is one of 
           the most successful entertainment franchises in history, known for its iconic 
           characters, ongoing game releases, and global community.</p>
